- packets queue in router buffers- usually one queue per port
- if arrival rate > capacity, packets queue (delay in wait)
- if there are no free buffers, packet gets dropped
- Sources of packet delay:
	- **Router processing delay**
		- need to process packet, determine output link, place in buffer
	- **Queueing delay**
		- wait at output link for transmission- based on congestion level. Usually rises with input rate
		- R = bandwidth (bps)
		- L = packet length
		- a = average packet arrival rate (pkts/s)
		- if infinite buffer space, `traffic intensity = La/R`
		- if p ~ 0, avg delay small
		- p >= 1: infinite delay (traffic spikes)
		- p = 1: some delay
	- **Transmission delay**
		- Time to send: L/R (L-> packet length in bits, R -> link rate in bps)
	- **Propogation delay**
		- increases with physical distance packet travels
		- d/s (distance in m / propagation speed, usually `2*10^8`)
- Nodal delay:
	- `d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop`
	- d_proc usually fixed, microsecs
	- d_queue based on congestion, varies randomly between packets
	- d_trans L/R as above
	- d_prop depends on physical link length
- Tracking delays:
	- ping to get delay between routers
	- **traceroute** (tracert on windows) gets delay measurement from source -> all routers to destination
- Packet loss
	- queue capacity is finite
	- **drop-tail queuing**: packets that arrive to a full buffer are dropped
	- lost packets can be retransmitted by prev router or source
	- **loss rate**: % data lost over long period
