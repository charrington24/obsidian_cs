#networking 
- need to keep track of hosts, routers, links, applications, protocols
- layering provides modular organization
- Two main rules:
	- Same host: each layer can only interact with adjacent layers; layers are all black boxes to each other
	- Remote host: each layer talks only to identical layer on other end
- Internet Protocol stack:
	- Application (top)
		- interacts with user 
		- Protocols: FTP, SMTP, HTTP
	- Transport
		- inter-process data transfer- deal with OS, interactions between operating systems, socket stuff, etc
		- Protocols: TCP, UDP
	- Network
		- routing datagrams from source to dest
		- Protocols: IP
	- Link
		- data transfer between adjacent network nodes
		- Protocols: 802.11b, Ethernet
	- Physical (bottom)
		- actual bits on the wire
