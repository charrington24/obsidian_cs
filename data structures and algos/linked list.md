### important patterns:
- [[remove instances from linked list]]
- [[adding numbers represented as linked lists]]
- [[linked list reversal]]
- find middle element  
- remove a middle element given only access to only it  
- find if circular  
- determine if two lists intersect (by reference)
### construction:
- init a head node to null
- 
#### time complexity:


### traversal:
- time complexity:  O(n)
- because to get to the kth node you have to visit every node until k

### insertion:
