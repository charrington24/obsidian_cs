- quantum computer is **not** just a faster version of a normal computer
- what types of algorithms are quantum computers good for?
- stores information in **qubits** 
	- superposition- qubit simultaneously stores some amount of 0 and some amount of 1. state is how much 0 vs how much 1 (probability of getting 0 or 1 when you read it)
	- measurement- when you read, you get either 0 or 1 and all the other one goes away. if you read it again, you'll always get the same answer
	- you can't make a copy of a qubit
	- entanglement- if a group of qubits is entangled, you can only talk about the state of the group. state is set of superposed states (2 qubits would be some superposition of 00, 01, 10, 11)
		- if entangled qubits are in a state and you read one, you know the value of the other one
