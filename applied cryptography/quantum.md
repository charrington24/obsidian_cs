- quantum computer is **not** just a faster version of a normal computer
- what types of algorithms are quantum computers good for?
- stores information in **qubits** 
	- superposition- qubit simultaneously stores some amount of 0 and some amount of 1. state is how much 0 vs how much 1 (probability of getting 0 or 1 when you read it)
		- measurement- when you read, you get either 0 or 1 and all the other one goes away. if you read it again, you'll always get the same answer
		- you can't make a copy of a qubit
	- entanglement- if a group of qubits is entangled, you can only talk about the state of the group. state is set of superposed states (2 qubits would be some superposition of 00, 01, 10, 11)
		- if entangled qubits are in a state and you read one, you know the value of the other one
		- group of n qubits has 2^n superposed states
			- same as with reading one qubit- once you read one, the other values go away
			- if you only read a subset (like the first qubit) it just shrinks the possibility space. so if you have 3 qubits and you read the first and it's 0, then your options are 000, 001, 010, 011
- superposition and entanglement make quantum powerful
- when you compute on n qubits, it's computing on all 2^n superposed values simultaneously
	- output state: add outputs of all inputs in proportion
	- but you can't read it without losing the superposition
	- the parallelism doesn't give you all 2^n answers; it only gives you one 
- how to initialize qubit to 0? 
	- read it- if it's a 0, yay. if it's a 1, put it through a not gate
- hadamard gate to create superposition
- you can only really use 1 or 2 qubit gates
- there are universal gate sets for quantum circuits (like NAND for classical)
- algorithms:
	- grover's: brute force search in square root of time
	- shor's: break modern public key algorithms in polynomial time
