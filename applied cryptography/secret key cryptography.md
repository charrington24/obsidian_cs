stream cipher
- seed (shared secret) fed into PRNG which are used as a one-time pad 
- pseudo-random number is not information-theoretic secure
block cipher
- input is fixed-size block + key
- output is fixed size ciphertext block (same size as input)
- decrypt with ciphertext block + key
- what's a good block size? what about a key size?
