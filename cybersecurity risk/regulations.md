#cybersecurity 

- ISO (International Standards Organization) is like NIST for international community. More complicated than NIST standards
- FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act, 2002) is the crucial law here- defined framework/security standards for information security in US
	- was updated in 2014 with Federal Information Security Modernization Act
	- requires risk assessments to be run
- NIST (under dpt of commerce) wrote the SP-800 series as a bunch of guides on cybersecurity risk. SP-800 isn't technically a standard but rather a guideline
