- **context-free grammar** can define **context-free languages**
- consist of four things:
	- nonterminal symbols (variables)
	- terminal symbols
	- production rules (nonterminal to terminal/nonterminal)
	- start symbol
- derivations:
	- leftmost: each step expands leftmost terminal
	- rightmost: same as leftmost but right
	- encode what productions were applied and in what order
	- parse tree encodes the steps
- similar to scanning, you can end up with two correct parse trees. this is called ambiguity
- CFG is **ambiguous** if there is at least one string with 2+ parse trees
- no algorithm for detecting whether a CFG is ambiguous
- also no algorithm for converting ambiguous to nonambiguous. Can't win
- no way to prove that a cfg is unambiguous?
