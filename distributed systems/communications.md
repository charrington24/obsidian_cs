- basic networking model: iSO model described in [[basic networking]] 
- why is the layer model so fragmented? 
	- allows you to plug and play- can mix wired and wireless layers
	- internet "bottleneck" is IP- all of internet uses this protocol
	- implemented by prepending a header to the payload received by layer above
- drawbacks: extra functionality, violates access control 
- we'll be most exposed to the **transport layer** in dist systems. TCP and UDP are the protocols used here
	- TCP: connection-oriented, reliable, stream
	- UDP: unreliable, best-effort
- where do sockets live? between the **session** and **transport** layers
- transport, network, data link, physical layer are all in kernel space, not user space (because they touch hardware)
- **middleware** lives above transport layer
	- provides common services/protocols that can be used by different applications
- adapted layering scheme:
	- application (application level protocol)
	- middleware (middleware protocol)
	- OS (host-to-host protocol)
	- hardware (physical/link-level protocol)
- client/server is transient and synchronous
	- client issues req and blocks until it gets reply
	- drawbacks: failures have to be handled immediately, client gets blocked, may not be ideal
- message-oriented-middleware
- NOTE: TODO: missed lecture on 1/31. Go back and fill in notes form remainder of lecture 3 slides (more detailed stuff on RPCs, sockets, DCE, request-reply, pipelines, publish-subscribe)
- **MPI (message passing interface)**- advanced transient messaging
	- mostly used when high-performance computing is needed
- **AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol)**
	- exchanges accept messages from producers and route them to queues
	- binding decouples message from producers and has rules for routing to destination queue
	- message queues are bound to an exchange and exist until used up by client
	- connection: physical TCP between client and producer. has many channels
	- channel: virtual conduit between client and broker
	- routing strategies: direct, fanout, topic, header. all use different algorithms
