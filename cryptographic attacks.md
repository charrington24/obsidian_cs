- ciphertext only
- known plaintext (enigma cipher)
- attacker can do chosen plaintext
- chosen ciphertext: if you make up a random number and send as message, some will fail but some will succeed. Info of what can be successfully decrypted and what can't is valuable information 
- side-channel attacks: run a diff process on machine doing a lot of encryption , there are side effects of cryptography that you can pick up on to figure out the key
- traffic analysis: look at encrypted message - even knowing who's talking to whom and for how long is useful even sans plaintext
