# obsidian_cs

hello! welcome to my computer science notes repository. i'm always trying to find the best way to catalogue my personal knowledge base, and after about a year of not using it i've decided to return to Obsidian. if you don't know, Obsidian is a note-taking platform optimized for connectivity and quick, unstructured data- much like our brains. all of these notes are just markdown files, so you can view them with or without Obsidian, but i'd recommend cloning the repo and using Obsidian to explore if you want a good look around.

currently, i've got a neo4j folder in this repo for neo4j-related notes, and a data structures/algorithms folder that i'm fleshing out to prepare for interviews. i plan to convert all of my old class notes into Obsidian (i've got notes from OS, computer organization, intro to computer systems, programming languages, discrete math, etc) but that's on the back-burner as i enter the semester. anyway, happy learning!
